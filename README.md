# Heroes of Might and Magic 3 (HoMM3) Savegame Editor

Well, I want to learn Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) by doing a project, and I recently
got back into playing HoMM3 after discovering the wonderful
[HoMM3 HD Mod](https://sites.google.com/site/heroes3hd/). With all the real-life responsibilities
these days, I can no longer bear the tedious part of the game, thus this savegame editor to make it
a little easier.

## Usage and Features

Download the latest binary release zip file (e.g. *Heroes3Editor-v1.0.zip*) from the
[Releases section](https://github.com/cysun/Heroes3Editor/releases). Unzip it to anywhere on your hard drive
then run `Heroes3Editor.exe` (no installation necessary).

Open a savegame file (.CGM for Campaign game save or .GM1 for Single Scenario game save), search for a hero by
name. You may search the same hero multiple times to locate multiple instances of the hero in the same savegame
file. Once a hero is found, you can edit the following:
* Primary skills (i.e. Attack, Defense, Spell Power, and Knowledge)
* Secondary skills and skill levels
* Spells
* Creature stack type and amount
* War machines (i.e. Ballista, Ammo Cart, First Aid Tent, and Cannon in HotA)
* Equipped artifacts

Support Horn of the Abyss (HotA) savegames as of Version 1.0.

## Known Issues

Combination Artifacts (e.g. Cloak of the Undead King) and spell scrolls are not supported. The program may crash if
you try to edit a hero equipped with a combo artifact or a spell scroll.

## About Savegame File Format

HoMM3 Savegame is supposed to be a GZip file, but all the tools/libraries either fail to unzip it
or complain about CRC error:
* [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/): can extract but complains about CRC error
* [GZipStream](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.compression.gzipstream?view=netcore-3.1):
  unsupported compression method exception
* [sharpcompress](https://github.com/adamhathcock/sharpcompress): unsupported compression method exception
* [SharpZipLib](https://github.com/icsharpcode/SharpZipLib): CRC exception

In particular, SharpZipLib can unzip it but will raise a CRC exception, which in some cases will stop halfway
through uncompression. This is the reason why I included part of SharpZipLib 1.2.0 source code in this
project -- it's the part that deals with GZip but with the line raising CRC exception commented out.
